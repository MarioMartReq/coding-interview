# Coding interview practice exercises.

Hi, this is a repo to keep track of all the coding exercises I have done. I'll try to keep them with a description, solution explanation and complexity analysis.

## Categories and problem list

### Arrays

- [Array rotation](arrays/array-rotation.py): Rotate an array a number of times to the right. Done in place and with complexity O(1).

_This is the place where I come to cry after I forget how to Python after some months doing just yamls_
