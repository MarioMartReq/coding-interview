# Coding interview practice exercises.

Hi, this is a repo to keep track of all the coding exercises I have done. I'll try to keep them with a description, solution explanation and complexity analysis.

## Categories and problem list.

### Arrays.

- [Array rotation](arrays/array-rotation.py): Rotate an array a number of times to the right. Done in place and with complexity O(1).
- [Remove duplicates](arrays/remove-duplicates.py): Remove the duplicates inside of a sorted list. This contains the generic one-line used to remove duplicates.
- [Matrix rotation](arrays/rotate-matrix.py): Rotate a matrix 90ยบ. The solution inside is done in a single line. Reverse + Transposition = Rotation.
- [Two sum target](arrays/two-sum-target.py): Find two elements inside of an array that by adding them you obtain the target number.
- [Zeroes to the back](arrays/zero-to-back.py): Move all zeroes in a list to the back without altering the order of the rest of the elements.

### Strings.

- [Reverse a number](strings/reverse-num.py): Reverse a number, including negatives.

### Algorithms.

- [Max profit](algorithms/max-profit.py): Find maximum profit obtainable by holding and selling from a period of stock prices.
- [Tree height](algorithms/tree-height-recursive.py): Find the height of a binary tree. This example does this recursively and implements a **Tree class**.
- [Triangles](algorithms/triangles.py): Find triplets that form a triangle, defined by a set of rules.

### Math.

- [FizzBuzz](math/fizzbuzz.py): Given a number, write a list of number up to that given numb and if it's divisible between 3 or/and 5 you write "Fuzz" or/and "Bizz" respectively.
- [Roman to integer](math/roman-to-int.py): Program to transform from roman to integer. Uses an inline iterator and a **dictionary**.
